# Rock Paper Scissors

## Brief

Develop a command line program which runs a game of Rock, Paper Scissors.

The program should give the player a choice of Rock/Paper/Scissors to play. This would be a good opportunity to practice using an Enum, since you're choosing between a set of constant values.

Then the program should randomly select the opposing move.

With both moves chosen, the program should determine who won, player or program.

It would be good to make this a best-of-three (a good use-case for a while loop).
