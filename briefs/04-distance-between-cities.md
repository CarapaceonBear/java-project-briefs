# Distance Between Two Cities

## Brief

Develop a command line program which takes in 2 cities, and gives the distance between them.

The program should have a list of cities it can search through, to find position data. This is a good opportunity to use streams, as well as try-catch. 

The maths for distances between longitude/latitude points is pretty heavy, so feel free to assume the cities are on a 2d map, and make up X/Y coordinates for them.

The program should take in 2 given cities, run a calculation, and show the calculated distance between them.

Have a class using Scanner for the user input.

## Extension

If you are using actual longitude/latitude data, [here is a resource on the maths behind that](https://www.omnicalculator.com/other/latitude-longitude-distance)
