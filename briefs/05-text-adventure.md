# Text Adventure Game

## Brief

Develop a command line text adventure game.

This brief is more open-ended. The game can take whichever form you like, as long as you are navigating through multiple rooms/scenes to reach an ending.

Each room/scene should be a class. The class should describe the room to the player, and give options for exploration and interaction.

It would be good to have a Character class, storing a name at minimum. It could also keep data for the character's health (if there are dangers along the adventure), or a list of items that the player can acquire (such as a key for a locked door).

Have a UserInput class, using Scanner, for taking player input.

I would suggest keeping the game small in scope, 10 rooms absolute maximum, or you'll be spending more time writing the story than practicing java.
