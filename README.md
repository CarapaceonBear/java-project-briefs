# java-project-briefs

In this repo are a series of briefs for Java projects. The briefs should test Java concepts, while being fun and interesting.

They are loosely ordered by complexity, number 1 being the simplest.

Everyone has a directory for building their projects, and can push their work to the repo. This way we can see how other people have tackled the briefs, or people can collaborate on a brief.

Within each brief is a diagram for a component tree. It will be hidden behind a spoiler tag, in case you want to design a structure from scratch in a way that makes sense to you. However, the tree is there for anyone needing a suggestion or starting point.

The brief may have extension tasks, and these will be more complicated. Don't feel pressured to tackle these. If you finish the base brief, you have accomplished the task and can move onto another one.
