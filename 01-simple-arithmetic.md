# Simple Arithmetic

## Brief

Develop a command line program which performs simple arithmetic calculations.

The program should take in 2 numbers, and an operator. The program will return the result of the calculation.<br>
eg. enter '3', enter '5', enter '+', program returns '3 + 5 = 8'<br>

It would be good to use a Scanner to take user input through the console, and to show the results message.

To get good practice with building classes and calling methods within them, it would be useful to have a different class for each operation.<br>
These classes can either be static, or they can be instanced when the program is run.

## Extension

Can we use what we learned with the javascript calculator project?

Have the program take in a full calculation (eg. '2 + 2), and interpret the input before calculating.<br>
You'll want to use a new class to read the input, which can then call the required classes that you've already made.

Can you make the program handle multiple operations (eg. '2 + 2 * 6)?
